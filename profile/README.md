# Who is o.s.a.f / apparel?

Nathan Buxton (GitHub user @n8bot) started o.s.a.f in July 2025 to explore open-source business, collaboration, and design in the fashion industry.

Hi. That's me, I'm Nathan.


# Collaboration, curation, documentation, and distribution

This is a collection of pre-existing open-source designs, methodologies, and resources—curated in this central location in order to facilitate further development.

- osaf.app is home to our open-source collaboration efforts on GitHub

- osafapparel.com is home to our commercial storefront


# Business and personal growth

The goal is to learn the concepts of fashion design in a collaborative and open environment, by bringing garments to market under the brand o.s.a.f / apparel.

This is to ask the questions: how can we close the gap between the users and designers of garments—how can we facilitate collaboration between them?


# Location

o.s.a.f / apparel is based in Vancouver, with contributions taken universally.
